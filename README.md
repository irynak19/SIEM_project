<h1>Vulnerability Management Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This lab is about vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. I will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order to run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, and then perform a rescan to verify remediation.
