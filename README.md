<h1>SIEM project: Microsoft Sentinel map with live cyber attacks</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I setup Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. By doing this I will be able to observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. I will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on the Microsoft Sentinel
